# SMAart View — Product Overview

SMAart View is a lightweight, privacy-first insights widget for real-estate websites.

It provides a calm, anonymous snapshot of how listings are actually perceived —
without cookies, without user tracking, and without analytics dashboards.

No noise.
No surveillance.
Just signal.

## What SMAart View shows

SMAart View renders a minimal on-page card with only the insights that matter:

- **Views (last 24h)**  
  How many times listings were viewed recently.

- **Top listing**  
  Which property currently attracts the most attention.

- **Top area**  
  Which location quietly builds interest.

- **Live pulse**  
  A subtle visual reaction to real visitor activity.

There are no charts to interpret,
no dashboards to log into,
and nothing that distracts from the core signal.

## Why SMAart View exists

Most real-estate websites today face one of three problems:

1. They rely on Google Analytics  
   (heavy, invasive, legally complex, and increasingly blocked).

2. They track nothing  
   and operate blind to user attention.

3. They use complex dashboards  
   that look impressive but are rarely opened.

SMAart View was created to keep only the **essential 1% of insight**:

> Anonymous, aggregated signals  
> that reveal what visitors actually notice.

It is designed to stay invisible to buyers,
while remaining useful to professionals.

## Privacy & GDPR philosophy

Privacy is not a feature.
It is the foundation.

SMAart View is GDPR-safe **by design**, not by configuration.

It collects:
- no cookies
- no IP addresses
- no user identifiers
- no fingerprinting data
- no cross-site tracking
- no personal profiles

Only short-lived, anonymous, aggregated events are processed.

As a result:
- no consent banners are required
- no third-party analytics policies are needed
- no legal ambiguity is introduced

---

## Product scope (Lite version)

SMAart View Lite focuses intentionally on a limited scope.

### Supported signals
- page views
- listing interaction
- area interest

### What it does NOT do
- no user journeys
- no funnels
- no demographic profiling
- no historical surveillance
- no behavioural prediction

This limitation is deliberate.
Clarity beats complexity.

## Installation concept

The widget is embedded directly into a website using a single script tag.

Each installation uses a simple `site_id` to isolate its data.

The widget:
- runs in an isolated environment
- does not interfere with site performance
- fails gracefully if unavailable
- never blocks page rendering

It can be used for:
- agent websites
- office landing pages
- listing previews
- demos and pilots

---

## Positioning

SMAart View is not a replacement for full analytics platforms.

It is a **calm companion**:
- for professionals who want awareness, not surveillance
- for European markets with strict privacy expectations
- for small and medium offices that value simplicity

It works best when left alone —
quietly present, never demanding attention.

---

## Relationship to the SMAart ecosystem

SMAart View is the foundation layer of the broader SMAart ecosystem.

Future modules build *on top* of this philosophy, not against it:

- deeper cost insights
- renovation scenarios
- investment comparisons
- AI-assisted reasoning

SMAart View stays small by design.
Other modules grow where complexity is justified.

---

## Product mindset

SMAart View follows three non-negotiable principles:

1. **Privacy over data hunger**
2. **Signal over noise**
3. **Clarity over features**

If a feature does not respect all three,
it does not belong here.
